## [2.1.0] - 2022-03-06

### Features

- New optional configuration option `todoist_user_id`. When set, tasks completed in project will score points only if they were assigned to you or no one, not when assigned to someone else. Who completed the task is not taken into account.

### Fixes

- Delay between each Habitica API action has been increased from 0.5s to 30s, as mandated by the official documentation.
- `x-client` HTTP header is being sent to notify the API of the author of the tool, as mandated by the official documentation.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-01-30
